# Mino1289

Welcome on my profile page !  
Here you can find all the work I've done so far.

## About me

I'm a 20 years old french student, studying at [UTBM](https://utbm.fr/ " ").  
I'm learning Maths and Computer Science.

## Main projects

I've worked on :

- **[Upsilon](https://github.com/Mino1289/Upsilon " ")** is my own fork from **[Upsilon](https://github.com/UpsilonNumworks/Upsilon " ")**.
- **[Python-for-Numworks](https://github.com/Mino1289/Python-for-Numworks " ")** which contain a lot of programs in python for the [Numworks](https://numworks.com " ") calculator.
- **[Mathsup](https://github.com/Mino1289/Mathsup " ")** Is a WIP project to interact easily between Maths Objects (Matrices, Polynomials, etc..). It can be view as a better implementation of Python-for-Numworks, because many function are in both (but in C).
- **[container](https://github.com/Mino1289/container " ")** Is a WIP management tool that aims to improve loading/unloading containers from ships.
- **[MNIST](https://github.com/Mino1289/MNIST " ")** Is my current work on basic IA understanding, with a demo.
- **[video-seg-inpainting](https://github.com/Mino1289/video-seg-inpainting " ")**, a project: human remover from video using simple image segmentation model and basic computer vision algorithms, might be improved in another project.

## UTBM's Projects :
- **[Boggle](https://github.com/Mino1289/Boggle " ")**, a game-console to play the Boggle (find words using letter in a grid) in C (UV: IF2).
- **[BeerAdvisor](https://github.com/Mino1289/BeerAdvisor " ")**, a website / social media about beers, using html, php and SQL (UV: IF3E).
- **[Project-LO21_A22](https://github.com/Mino1289/Project-LO21_A22 " ")**, it's a simplified version of genetic algorithms, which is one of the approaches to solve optimization problems (UV: LO21).
- **[Project-LP25_A22](https://github.com/Mino1289/Project-LP25_A22 " ")**, a multi-threaded email parser (UV: LP25).
- **[Project-AP4A_A23](https://github.com/Mino1289/AP4A_Project " ")**, a small sensor manager app in C++ (UV: AP4A).
- **[TuringMachine-AP4B_A23](https://github.com/Mino1289/AP4B_TuringMachine " ")**, TuringMachine game implementation in Java (UV: AP4B).
- **[W-WE4A_P24](https://github.com/Mino1289/WE4A-W " ")**, a social network in php W: "winners!" (UV: WE4A).
- **[Kareer-WE4B_P24](https://github.com/Mino1289/Kareer " ")**, a multi-company job board, HR side & Job seeker side (UV: WE4B)
- **[TSP-Methods_P24](https://github.com/Mino1289/IT45_TSP " ")**, different solving method for the Traveling Salesman Problem (UV: IT45)
- **[AI-Training](https://github.com/DE50-AI-Training/ " ")**, "What AI should learn from software engineering", an UI-based AI training mainly focused for non-technical people. You have Data ? -> Train your own model easily to learn / predict from your data.
