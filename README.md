# Mino1289

Welcome on my profile page !  
Here you can find all the work I've done so far.

## About me

I'm 18 years old and live in France, I'm studying at [UTBM](https://utbm.fr/ " ").  
I'm learning Maths and Computer Science.

## Main projects

I've worked on :

- **[Upsilon](https://github.com/Mino1289/Upsilon " ")** is my own fork from **[Upsilon](https://github.com/UpsilonNumworks/Upsilon " ")**.
- **[Python-for-Numworks](https://github.com/Mino1289/Python-for-Numworks " ")** which contain a lot of programs in python for the [Numworks](https://numworks.com " ") calculator.
- **[Mathsup](https://github.com/Mino1289/Mathsup " ")** Is a WIP project to interact easily between Maths Objects (Matrices, Polynomials, etc..). It can be view as a better implementation of Python-for-Numworks, because many function are in both (but in C).


## UTBM's Projects :
- **[Boggle](https://github.com/Mino1289/Boggle " ")**, a game-console to play the Boggle (find words using letter in a grid) in C (UV: IF2).
- **[BeerAdvisor](https://github.com/Mino1289/BeerAdvisor " ")**, a website / social media about beers, using html, php and SQL (UV: IF3E).
- **[Project-LO21_A22](https://github.com/Mino1289/Project-LO21_A22 " ")**, it's a simplified version of genetic algorithms, which is one of the approaches to solve optimization problems (UV: LO21).
- **[lo21](https://github.com/Mino1289/lo21 " ")**, a library to interact with all data structures studied in LO21 (Not a Project).
