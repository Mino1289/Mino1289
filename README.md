# Mino1289

Welcome on my profile page !  
Here you can find all the work I've done so far.

## About me

I'm 18 years old and live in France, I'm studying at [UTBM](https://utbm.fr/ " ").  
I'm learning Maths and Computer Science.

## Main projects

I've worked on :

- **[Upsilon](https://github.com/Mino1289/Upsilon " ")** is my own fork from **[Upsilon](https://github.com/UpsilonNumworks/Upsilon " ")**.
- **[Python-for-Numworks](https://github.com/Mino1289/Python-for-Numworks " ")** which contain a lot of programs in python for the [Numworks](https://numworks.com " ") calculator.
- **[Mathsup](https://github.com/Mino1289/Mathsup " ")** Is a WIP project to interact easily between Maths Objects (Matrices, Polynomials, etc..). It can be view as a better implementation of Python-for-Numworks, because many function are in both (but in C).


I will add the projects I'm working on at UTBM.
## UTBM's Projects :
- **[Boggle](https://github.com/Mino1289/Boggle " ")**, a game-console to play the Boggle (find words using letter in a grid) in C.
- **[BeerAdvisor](https://github.com/Mino1289/BeerAdvisor " ")**, a website / social media about beers, using html, php and SQL.
